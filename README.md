# St. Louis Jail Data

This is a large dataset. To make the import less resource-intensive, I used csvkit to pare down the number of columns before import. To do this yourself, first install [csvkit](https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit), then run the script:

`./python jail_data.py`

Code provided for transparency's sakeâ€”not because it's going to win any awards.
